## The Process

1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, corrected data types(vendors,ProfitMargin,StockTurnover), and removed duplicates using a Python script (`scripts/data_cleaning.py`).
2.  **Data Modeling:** Created relationships between different tables () within Power BI.
3.  **Dashboard Creation:** Developed interactive visuals in Power BI, including KPIs for VenderName, profit margin, and Topsaleing brands. The final file is `powerbi/sales_dashboard.pbix`.
